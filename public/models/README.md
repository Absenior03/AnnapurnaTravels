# 3D Models Directory

This directory should contain the following 3D model files:

1. `mountain.glb` - A low-poly mountain model used in the Mountain component
2. `compass.glb` - A compass model used in the 3D scene

Please add these models to enable full functionality of the 3D scenes. If these models are missing, the application will use fallback displays.
