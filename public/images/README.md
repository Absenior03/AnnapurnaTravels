# Image Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following image files used by the application:

1. `mountains-fallback.jpg` - Fallback image for when 3D mountain rendering fails
2. `mountain-backdrop.jpg` - Background image for the mountain showcase section

Please add these image files to enable proper fallback displays when 3D content cannot be rendered.
